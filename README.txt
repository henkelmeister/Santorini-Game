Welcome to the Santorini game!

How to format moves:
- Enter moves as an ordered pair together, row and column
- row is up and down and collumn is left and right  
Example: 
- if you wanted row 5 and column 2 (5 down two acrross) 
- Format as: 52 

How to play:
-Start the game by choosing a starting coordinate. 
-You are P and the Ai is A
-You can only move your player right, left, up, down, and diagonal.
-You win the game by having 10 spaces = 4 
-You lose the game by having 10 spaces = 0
-Ever time you move the ocagonal around you goes up by 1
-If the Ai's octagonal and your octagonal share a coordinate then the coordinate will remain unchanged 
-The game will automatically end once you or the computer wins

Good luck!
